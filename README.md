# Prompt Injection on Large Language Models
This is the submission for the Project for ML in Cybersecurity at NYU Tandon. <br>
<br>

**Developers: Karan Sheth, Mujahid Ali Quidwai, Utkarsh Shekhar**    

## Overview
The objective of this project is to analyse the impact of Prompt Injection on Large Language Models like GPT-3. The project further attempts to automate the process of generating promtpt by fine-tuning a T5-Base model for creating false data  <br>

## Requirements/Prerequisites
* OpenAI playground account to run the injection queries
* GPU that can load T5-Base in memory

## Recreating the results
* Load the pre-trained results available for the model. 
* run test function with your custom imput
* Use the prediction to generate the prompt from the parser and run it on GPT-3 


## Results 
Sample of injections attacks on GPT-3
